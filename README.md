# MINKOWSKISUM-ComputationalGeometry
Computational Geometry P295,simply implements the MINKOWSKISUM algorithm

the project calculate

there are three classes in the project
* **CSpace** for the main algorithm
* **CPanel** for draw the result
* **Polygon** for the polygon store and read from files

just change the file path, the result can be calculated and shown.
